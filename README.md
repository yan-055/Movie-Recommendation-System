# Movie Recommendation System
This is a movie recommendation system using collabrotive filtering technique. 

A deep learning algorithm - autoencoder - is applied to build a model which could recommend 10 new (unwatched) movies to users.

The DL model is trained and evaluated based on MovieLens 100K Dataset.

[This project](https://github.com/yan-055/Movie-recommendation-system/blob/main/movie%20recommender.ipynb) provides a detailed description about recommender systems and the autoencoder model.
