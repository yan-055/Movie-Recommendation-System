# Movie-recommendation-system
This is a movie recommendation system using collabrotive filtering technique. 

A deep learning algorithm autoencoder is used to build the model which could recommend the top-10 movies to users.

The data used to train the model is MovieLens 100K Dataset.

[This project](https://github.com/yan-055/Movie-recommendation-system/blob/main/movie%20recommender.ipynb) provides a detailed description about recommender systems and the autoencoder model.
