# Movie Recommendation System
This is a movie recommendation system using collabrotive filtering technique. A deep learning algorithm - autoencoder - is applied to build a model which could recommend 10 unwatched movies to each user.

In [this project](https://github.com/yan-055/Movie-recommendation-system/blob/main/movie%20recommender.ipynb), the model is trained based on MovieLens 100K Dataset, which implements an autoencoder to reconstruct a userâ€™s ratings of all items. The precision and recall for each user and the average precision and recall across all users are calcuated to evaluate the model's performance.

A gentle description to recommender systems and autoencoder neural networks is provided in this project.
