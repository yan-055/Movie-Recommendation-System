# Movie Recommendation System
This is a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering technique. A deep learning algorithm - autoencoder - is applied to build a model which could recommend 10 movies (unwatched) to each user.

[In this project](https://github.com/yan-055/movie-recommendation-system/blob/main/implement_autoencoder.ipynb), the model is trained based on MovieLens 100K Dataset, which implements an autoencoder neural network to reconstruct a userâ€™s ratings of all movies. Precision and recall are calcuated to evaluate the model's performance.

This project also provides a gentle description to recommender systems and autoencoders.
