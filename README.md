# Movie Recommendation System
This is a movie recommendation system using collabrotive filtering technique. A deep learning algorithm - autoencoder - is applied to build a model which could recommend 10 movies (unwatched) to each user.

[In this project](https://github.com/yan-055/Movie-recommendation-system/blob/main/movie%20recommender.ipynb), the model is trained based on MovieLens 100K Dataset, which implements an autoencoder neural network to reconstruct a userâ€™s ratings of all movies. The precision and recall for each user and the average precision and recall across all users are calcuated to evaluate the model's performance.

This project also provides a gentle description to recommender systems and autoencoders.
